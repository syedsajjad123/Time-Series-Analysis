Apple Stock Price Time Series Analysis

This project analyzes historical Apple stock prices to uncover trends and patterns using time-series techniques. Itâ€™s a demonstration of data handling and automation skills in Python.

Tools
- Python
- Pandas (data manipulation)
- NumPy (numerical operations)
- Matplotlib (visualization, if used)
- stats library python (Time Series Analysis)

How It Works
1. Data Fetching: Pulls Apple stock data CSV.
2. Preprocessing: Cleans data by removing missing values and outliers, applies smoothing and making data stationary.
3. Analysis: Computes time-series metrics like moving averages to highlight trends, seasonality and residual.
4. Visualization: Plots results (e.g., price over time) for easy interpretation.

Notes
Built as a personal project to explore time-series analysis; can be adapted to other financial datasets. See code comments for details.
